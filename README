==============================================
== Running the viewer on your local machine ==
==============================================

Run the following in a shell, to build the javascipt and html up
for constituent files, and then to grab real live data to test
with from the real groundcrew.us server and cache it locally.

% make
% make grab GCUN='<your groundcrew.us email>' GCPW='<your password>'

At this point you should be able to run the viewer locally in
firefox or safari or whatever:

% open dist/viewer.html     # or...
% firefox dist/viewer.html

If you change javascript, html or css files, you have to run
'make' to rebuild.

The only thing that doesn't work quite right in local mode are
the user images.  Sorry about that.




===========================
== Navigating the source ==
===========================

Here are the directories we use:

	src/{dialogs,displays,infowindows,menus,widgets}
	- this is all code for various "views" that the viewer can pop up

	src/models
	- the underlying objects -- agents, landmarks, etc

	src/viewer
	- glue code

	lib
	- library code, including the gclib library of js utility functions

	vendor
	- javascript from outside sources

	test
	- qunit javascript tests
