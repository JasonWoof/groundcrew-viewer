/model

 - These files are used to dress up incoming json with additional calculated
   fields so it's ready to render.  Client-side databases are also here.

/view

  - These files contain templates used for rendering, well organized, plus any
    additional rendering code. Also contains "widgets" that are client side
    only, and that don't correspond to json objects received from the server.

/controller 

  - These files contain jquery plugins for each kind of object that we need to
    render. These are called on the rendered templates before they are
    inserted in the DOM.
